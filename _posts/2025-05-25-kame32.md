I'm excited to introduce Kame32, a completely redesigned version of the original Minikame robot I created back in 2016. This new version features a much more polished design and is optimized for widely available and affordable components. The frame is designed to house SG90 or MG90s servos (3d parts are available for each model), which are significantly cheaper than the original Minikame servos. The control board has also been upgraded to an ESP32, a step up from the older ESP8266.

In addition to refining the design for a smoother assembly, I’ve also created a custom PCB to simplify wiring and added some thoughtful details like a power button and a battery connector mount. This means no more messy cables hanging out of the robot, everything is more compact and integrated.

In the coming days, I’ll be publishing the repository with all the necessary files: 3D parts, code, and PCB layout. This time around, I'm also putting extra effort into writing clear and thorough documentation.

Here is a video of Kame32 in action:
