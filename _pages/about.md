Hi! I'm Javier Isabel a passionate robotics maker, and open-source enthusiast. Over the years, I've designed and built a variety of robots, including Zowi and Minikame, both 3D-printable and widely used in the DIY and educational robotics scenes. Iâ€™m especially fascinated by legged robots and I actively compete in robotics events across categories like combat, micromouse, and line-following.

I develop everything using open-source tools, and I publish all my work on GitHub to keep it accessible and hackable. This site is where I document my projects, share assembly guides, and post updates on my experiments in robotics. Whether you're here to learn, replicate, or just get inspired, welcome!
